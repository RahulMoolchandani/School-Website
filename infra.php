    <h3><b>School Building</b></h3>
    <p>A vast expanse of 3 acres provides a perfect ambience for an aesthetically chartered school building. 
    The lung space, the open lawns are marked with a colourful bonanza of fresh floral bounty.</p>
    <p>An awe inspiring wi-fi enabled infrastructure comprising of 90 well ventilated classrooms, science,
    maths and language laboratories and libraries where books span time, space, culture and genre. 
    To aid the process of learning we have a sound proof auditorium, state of art recording studio, 
    an av room, two resource centres for teachers, a sports field, a basement to facilitate physical fitness and 
    indoor games, a discovery room to enhance the scientific temperament and an art gallery to showcase
    the creative flair of the students.</p>
